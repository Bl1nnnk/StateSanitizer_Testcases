Specify one of the following values.\\nValue\\nMeaning\\nPDH_LOG_READ_ACCESS\\nOpen the log file for reading.\\nPDH_LOG_WRITE_ACCESS\\nOpen a new log file for writing. \\nPDH_LOG_UPDATE_ACCESS\\nOpen an existing log file for writing.\\n\\xa0\\nYou can use the bitwise inclusive  OR operator (|) to combine the access type with one or more of the following creation flags.\\nValue\\nMeaning\\nPDH_LOG_CREATE_NEW\\nCreates a new log file with the specified name.\\nPDH_LOG_CREATE_ALWAYS\\nCreates a new log file with the specified name. If the log file already exists, the function removes the existing log file before creating the new file.\\nPDH_LOG_OPEN_EXISTING\\nOpens an existing log file with the specified name. If a log file with the specified name does not exist, this is equal to PDH_LOG_CREATE_NEW.\\nPDH_LOG_OPEN_ALWAYS\\nOpens an existing log file with the specified name or creates a new log file with the specified name.\\nPDH_LOG_OPT_CIRCULAR\\nCreates a circular log file with the specified name. When the file reaches the value of the dwMaxSize parameter, data wraps to the beginning of the log file. You can specify this flag only if the lpdwLogType parameter is PDH_LOG_TYPE_BINARY.\\nPDH_LOG_USER_STRING\\nUsed with PDH_LOG_TYPE_TSV to write the user caption or log file description indicated by the szUserString parameter of PdhUpdateLog or PdhOpenLog. The user caption or log file description is written  as the  last column in the first line of the text log.\\n[in] lpdwLogType\\nType of log file to open. This parameter can be one of the following values.\\nValue\\nMeaning\\nPDH_LOG_TYPE_UNDEFINED\\nUndefined log file format. If specified, PDH determines the log file type. You cannot specify this value if the dwAccessFlags parameter is PDH_LOG_WRITE_ACCESS.\\nPDH_LOG_TYPE_CSV\\nText file containing column headers in the first line, and individual data records in each subsequent line. The fields of each data  record are comma-delimited.\\nThe first line also contains information about the format of the file, the PDH version used to create the log file, and the names and paths of each of the counters.\\nPDH_LOG_TYPE_SQL\\nThe data source of the log file is an SQL database.\\nPDH_LOG_TYPE_TSV\\nText file containing column headers in the first line, and individual data records in each subsequent line. The fields of each data  record are tab-delimited.\\nThe first line also contains information about the format of the file, the PDH version used to create the log file, and the names and paths of each of the counters.\\nPDH_LOG_TYPE_BINARY\\nBinary log file format.\\n[in] hQuery\\nSpecify a query handle if you are writing query data to a log file. The\\nPdhOpenQuery function returns this handle.\\nThis parameter is ignored and should be NULL if you are reading from the log file.\\n[in] dwMaxSize\\nMaximum size of the log file, in bytes. Specify the maximum size if you want to limit the file size or if dwAccessFlags specifies PDH_LOG_OPT_CIRCULAR; otherwise, set to 0.\\nFor circular log files, you must specify a value large enough to hold at least one sample.   Sample size depends on data being collected. However, specifying a value of at least one megabyte will cover most samples.\\n[in] szUserCaption\\nNull-terminated string that specifies the user-defined caption of the log file. A log file caption generally describes the contents of the log file. When an existing log file is opened, the value of this parameter is ignored.\\n[out] phLog\\nHandle to the opened log file.\\nReturn value:\\nIf the function succeeds, it returns ERROR_SUCCESS.\\nIf the function fails, the return value is a\\nsystem error code or a\\nPDH error code.\\nRemarks:\\nTo use this function to write performance data to a log file, you must open a query using\\nPdhOpenQuery and add the desired counters to it, before calling this function.\\nNewer operating systems can read log files that were generated on older operating systems; however, log files that were created on Windows\\xa0Vista and later operating systems cannot be read on earlier operating systems.\\nThe following rules apply to log files\\nREAD_ACCESS requires OPEN_EXISTING.\\nUPDATE_ACCESS cannot be used with file-based logs. It can only be used with database logs.\\nWRITE_ACCESS requires one of CREATE_NEW, CREATE_ALWAYS, OPEN_EXISTING, OPEN_ALWAYS.\\nExamples:\\nFor an example, see\\nWriting Performance Data to a Log File.\\nNote\\nThe pdh.h header defines PdhOpenLog as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant.
